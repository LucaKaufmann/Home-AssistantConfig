# HomeAssistant-Config
Example configuration for HomeAssistant. Using the following components:

- Philips Hue
- Xiaomi
- Darksky
- iOS component
- Google Cast
- Plex
- HAFloorplan

My setup is running on a Raspberry Pi along with Homebridge (for Homekit integration), Pihole ad blocker and OpenVPN. DuckDNS and Letsencrypt are set up as well to allow access from outside the network.
